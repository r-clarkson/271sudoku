# 271sudoku
Final project for COMP 271: sudoku generator/solver

======================================
INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPILING AND RUNNING
======================================

-sfml must be installed (can be downloaded at http://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php)

-follow the "getting started" tutorial for instsalling sfml as a framework at http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/

-then compile (in terminal) with command "g++ -framework sfml-graphics -framework sfml-window -framework sfml-system main.cpp"

-run with ./a.out

================
NOTES ABOUT CODE
================

-bugs

  *the replay button does not always work

  *can't maximize screen without errors

-these bugs are because it was my first time learning/using sfml and thus the graphics code is specific to my computer and somewhat bulky/messy 

-however, the code for generating/solving a puzzle is efficient and works well (which is the point of the project)
